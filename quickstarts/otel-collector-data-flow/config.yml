# Long-form description of the quickstart (required)
description: |
  The OpenTelemetry Collector Data Flow quickstart contains a dashboard that helps visualize the flow of data through the collector, monitor the collector's performance, and identify telemetry bottlenecks. The dashboard includes performance metrics related to the telemetry pipeline, such as the number of metrics, logs, and traces processed, refused, and dropped. Also included are CPU and Memory consumption, and stats related to the batch processor.

  ## Requirements

  The OpenTelemetry Collector Internal Telemetry must be enabled to collect the metrics required for this dashboard. For more information, see the [OpenTelemetry Collector Internal Telemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/internal-telemetry/#configure-internal-metrics).
