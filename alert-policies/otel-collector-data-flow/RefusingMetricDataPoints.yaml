# Name of the alert
name: OpenTelemetry Collector - Refusing Metric Data Points

# Description and details
description: |+
  This alert will notify you when the OpenTelemetry Collector is refusing metric data points. This could be due to a misconfiguration or a bottleneck in the pipeline. Investigate the cause of the refusal to ensure that all metric data points are being processed correctly.

# Type of alert
type: STATIC

# NRQL query
nrql:
  query: "from Metric select sum(otelcol_receiver_refused_metric_points) facet k8s.pod.name, receiver, transport"

# Function used to aggregate the NRQL query value(s) for comparison to the terms.threshold (Default: SINGLE_VALUE)
valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE 

# List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition
terms:
  # - priority: CRITICAL
  #   # Operator used to compare against the threshold.
  #   operator: ABOVE | BELOW | EQUALS
  #   # Value that triggers a violation; float value
  #   threshold: 90
  #   # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600
  #   thresholdDuration: 600
  #   # How many data points must be in violation for the duration
    # thresholdOccurrences: ALL | AT_LEAST_ONCE

  # Adding a Warning threshold is optional
  - priority: WARNING
    operator: ABOVE
    threshold: 0
    thresholdDuration: 180
    thresholdOccurrences: ALL

# Loss of Signal Settings
expiration: {}
  # # Close open violations if signal is lost (Default: false)
  # closeViolationsOnExpiration: false
  # # Open "Loss of Signal" violation if signal is lost (Default: false)
  # openViolationOnExpiration: false
  # # Time in seconds; Max value: 172800 (48hrs), null if closeViolationsOnExpiration and openViolationOnExpiration are both 'false'
  # expirationDuration: 

# Advanced Signal Settings
# Duration of the time window used to evaluate the NRQL Condition
signal:
  # How long we wait for data that belongs in each aggregation window 
  aggregationDelay: 120 # seconds
  # The method that determines when we consider an aggregation window to complete so that we can evaluate the signals for violations.
  aggregationMethod: EVENT_FLOW
  # How long we wait after each data point arrives to make sure we've processed the whole batch.
  aggregationTimer: 1200 # seconds
  # Controls the duration of the time window used to evaluate the NRQL query 
  aggregationWindow: 60 # seconds; 30 seconds <= x < 15 minutes
  # Option that determines the type of value that should be used to fill gaps (empty windows).
  fillOption: STATIC
  # If using the static fill option, this value is used for filling.
  fillValue: 0 # default
  # This setting gathers data in overlapping time windows to smooth the chart line, making it easier to spot trends.

# Duration after which a violation automatically closes
# Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day])
